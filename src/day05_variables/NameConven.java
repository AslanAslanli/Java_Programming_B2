 Variable name rules in Java:
    -- Variable names have to be unique in the same method
    -- camel case applied
    -- can not use Java related words or Reserved words for variables. Ex, int public = 5;
    -- letters and numbers are ok
    -- Only two characters: $ and _
    -- NO space in variable name
    -- can NOT start with a number
